What was impressive was how smart, cool and observant she was for her age; how she discussed the motivations of her characters and the quirks of her directors.</p><p>I was interviewing her for “<a href=#>Freaky Friday</a>” (1977) or one of those other Disney movies she made. She met me at a health food place on Sunset Boulevard - no publicist in tow - and ordered something with a lot of alfalfa sprouts in it. The next time I saw her, she was already 13, and translating from French to English and back again at the Cannes Film Festival, where she starred in “<a href=#>Taxi Driver</a>.” I mention these meetings for a reason. I sensed a quality in Jodie Foster than I also sense in Fred Tate: a certain balance, a certain perspective on the strangeness of life. Despite spending 25 of her 28 years in show business, Foster is sane, focused and not much impressed by showbiz glitter. Fred Tate is the same way; he looks at things with a level eye, he is not neurotic, he handles a roller-coaster childhood without going nuts.</p><p>And that's one reason why “Little Man Tate” isn't precisely the movie you'd expect. The child genius (<a href=#>Adam Hann-Byrd</a>) is not treated as a sideshow stunt, nor as a cute gimmick, but as a miniature human being who brings out the worst, and best, of those around him. As the movie opens, he is amazing his mother, Dede (Foster), by reading the bottom of his cereal bowl when he is hardly big enough to lift it. Soon he is painting, playing piano and attracting the attention of Jane Grierson (<a href=#>Dianne Wiest</a>), a child psychologist who runs a school for gifted kids.</p><p>What Foster and her screenwriter, <a href=#>Scott Frank</a>, know about gifted kids is that you mustn't forget they're still kids. One of my favorite characters in the movie is an adolescent “mathemagician” with a lightning mind but an obnoxious personality, who wears a magician's cape at all times and in all places. He's hard on Fred when he first comes to Grierson's school, but eventually confides that he has no friends, and that if it weren't for his brains, “I'd just be another asshole with a cape.” Wiest plays the psychologist as someone who knows everything about children in theory, and nothing in practice. She has an oddly formal way of speaking to Fred, as if she were giving dictation, and she doesn't have a clue about the needs of a kid his age. Foster, as the mother, may not know much about the theory of child geniuses, but she knows her little boy and is fiercely protective of him, and although sparks fly between the two women eventually there is a rapprochement based on their mutual love of Fred.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46loK2snJp6rq3NZquarJVifnqFkA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flittle-man-tate-1991.html&text=Little%20Man%20Tate%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%281991%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flittle-man-tate-1991.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flittle-man-tate-1991.html&title=Little%20Man%20Tate%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%281991%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flittle-man-tate-1991.html&title=Little%20Man%20Tate%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%281991%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flittle-man-tate-1991.html&title=Little%20Man%20Tate%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%281991%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flittle-man-tate-1991.html&description=Little%20Man%20Tate%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%281991%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-the-bachelorette-host-jesse-palmers-wife-emely-fardo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is The Bachelorette host Jesse Palmers wife, Emely Fardo?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nurse-3d-2014.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nurse 3D movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
