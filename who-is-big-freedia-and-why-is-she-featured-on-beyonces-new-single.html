Ahead of its release, the singer has dropped her first single from the album, “Break My Soul”. The disco-like track comes courtesy of the same team who co-produced her hit song “Single Ladies” (Tricky Stewart and The-Dream), and is currently doing what Beyoncé music does best, and that’s breaking the internet. While the twenty-eight-time Grammy Award-winning artist is rightfully deserving of the attention, it’s the accompanying singer featured on the track who’s receiving just as much, if not more, buzz than the Queen Bey.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>Here’s everything you need to know about who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Freedia</a> is and why her collaboration on “Break My Soul” is setting the Beyoncé fandom ablaze.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-big-freedia-is-the-queen-of-bounce data-injectable=false>Big Freedia is the Queen of Bounce</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>It feels surreal to be on the track with the Queen Beyonce once again I’m so honored to be apart of this special moment I’m forever grateful lord 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥someone please catch me 🤩 <a href=#>#beyonce</a> <a href=#>#bigfreedia</a> <a href=#>#BreakMySoul</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AL8jn5lX6J</a></p>— Big Freedia 💋 (@bigfreedia) <a href=#>June 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Big Freedia is a New Orleans-based hip-hop artist who is known by many as the Queen of Bounce. Bounce music is a genre of hip hop that has lived relatively underground since its birth in the early 1990s, but thanks to Big Freedia the style of music has gained mainstream popularity, especially as of late. Her music is considered a cornerstone in the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>The rapper was the star of her own reality show Big Freedia Bounces Back​, which aired from 2013 to 2017. The show’s popularity, mixed with her signature sound, caught the attention of listeners and artists around the globe, including Beyoncé’s, who asked Freedia to collaborate on her track “Formation” from the hit album “Lemonade”</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Big Freedia’s career has seen a steady progression since 2017. The rapper has not only collaborated with high-profile artists year after year, but also made appearances on various TV shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Real Housewives of Atlanta,&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, among others.</p><h3 id=h-she-s-been-around-for-a-while data-injectable=false>She’s been around for a while</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true></figure><p id=h-asfasdf data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>It may seem like Big Freedia got her big break from Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul”, but the Queen of Bounce has been making music as since the early 2010s with various collaborations. Her first single “Booty-Whop” released in 2012, the same year she collaborated with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul</a> on his single Peanut Butter. The song was lip-synced on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars by drag queens Shangella and Trixie Mattel, turning the song into a hit among Drag Race fans.</p><h3 id=h-she-identifies-as-a-gay-man data-injectable=false>She identifies as a gay man</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1189821191.jpg><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=869 data-injectable=true>Big Freedia spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Out</a> magazine about her preferred pronouns in 2013 following her appearance on RuPaul’s Drag Race. She told the magazine she prefers to be called ‘she’, but clarified that she is comfortable with her fans calling her either ‘he’ or ‘she’. Such transitions between pronouns are commonplace in drag communities where performers go by ‘she’ while in drag and ‘he’ while out of drag. That being said, Big Freedia, like some drag queens, doesn’t have a tight grip on either pronoun.</p><p>When it comes to the pronouns he/she, I’m comfortable with who I am… I have fans who say “he” all the time; I have fans who say “she” all the time. I’m confident in who I am, and I know what I stand for… Whatever makes my fans comfortable… I let them have the freedom to choose either one…&nbsp;A lot of people just can’t accept the fact of calling a man “she.” I totally understand that, and it’s never offensive to me, because I was born a man, my preferred pronoun is she—but it’s not a big thing to me.</p><h3 id=h-this-isn-t-her-first-high-profile-collaboration data-injectable=false>This isn’t her first high-profile collaboration&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Big Freedia’s first high-profile collaboration was in 2016 when she was featured on Beyoncé groundbreaking hit song “Formation.” Her name might not be featured on the track but it is very much her voice in the background. Her distinctive voice eventually captured the attention of fellow rapper, Drake as she was featured on his song “Nice for What,” but was uncredited for it.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>In the years 2018 to today, Big Freedia has collaborated with a variety of artists including Lizzo (“Karaoke (feat. Lizzo)”), Rebecca Black (“Friday (remix)”), Kesha (“Raising Hell”), and Lady Gaga the tenth anniversary of “Born This Way” (“Judas”).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>The New Orleans bounce rapper has an authority that comes across in her vocals that makes her instantly recognizable. It’s that kind of recognizability that has undoubtedly contributed to her steady growth in the music industry and landed her another feature on Beyoncé’s album.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>As it turns out, “Break My Soul” is heavily influenced by, and even sample’s, Big Freedia’s song “Explode” from her 2014 album “Just Be Free.” In speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a>, Big Freedia relayed how the collaboration began saying, “My manager called and said, ‘Beyoncé wanted to use one of your songs on her new album.’ And I was like, ‘Holy crap. What is going on? Another One?’ I was like, ‘This is happening again?’”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Her contribution to the song easily takes the song from good to great. Needless to say, fans of the Queen of Bounce have a lot to look forward to. “Break My Soul” marks the beginning of a new chapter for the Queen of Bounce, one that is likely to be her biggest and most notable yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn6hlmah6o7XGZp2rnZWZtqJ5wKebZq%2BYrnqqv4ysn55llpqutcHRnptmp55ir6bFzqeanqtdo7K4edKipaCklWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-big-freedia-and-why-is-she-featured-on-beyonces-new-single.html&text=Who%20is%20Big%20Freedia%2c%20and%20why%20is%20she%20featured%20on%20Beyoncs%20new%20single%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-big-freedia-and-why-is-she-featured-on-beyonces-new-single.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-big-freedia-and-why-is-she-featured-on-beyonces-new-single.html&title=Who%20is%20Big%20Freedia%2c%20and%20why%20is%20she%20featured%20on%20Beyoncs%20new%20single%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-big-freedia-and-why-is-she-featured-on-beyonces-new-single.html&title=Who%20is%20Big%20Freedia%2c%20and%20why%20is%20she%20featured%20on%20Beyoncs%20new%20single%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-big-freedia-and-why-is-she-featured-on-beyonces-new-single.html&title=Who%20is%20Big%20Freedia%2c%20and%20why%20is%20she%20featured%20on%20Beyoncs%20new%20single%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-big-freedia-and-why-is-she-featured-on-beyonces-new-single.html&description=Who%20is%20Big%20Freedia%2c%20and%20why%20is%20she%20featured%20on%20Beyoncs%20new%20single%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alaskan-bush-people-bird-rain-brown-eyeliner-charcoal-cvs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alaskan Bush People's Bird &amp;amp; Rain Brown slammed for making eyeliner out of CHARCOAL when they 'live ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./watch-new-teaser-for-overlord-season-4-announces-release-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch: New teaser for Overlord season 4 announces release date">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
