If the system language is Japanese, it always defaults to kana instead of kanji. The user may change the language at any time by pressing L from the title screen, but this choice is not preserved if the app is closed, reverting to the default language again.</p><p>The software allows Pokémon to be sent from the <a href=# title="Generation V">Generation V</a> <a href=# title="Core series">core series</a> games and the <a href=# title="Virtual Console">Virtual Console</a> releases of the <a href=# title="Generation I">Generation I</a> and <a href=# title="Generation II">II</a> core series games to <a href=# title="Pokémon Bank">Pokémon Bank</a>.

Pokémon sent from the Virtual Console releases of the Generation I and Generation II games can be withdrawn from Pokémon Bank in Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon only.</p><p>Poké Transporter allows the player to select an inserted physical copy of <a href=# title="Pokémon Black and White Versions">Pokémon Black, White</a>, <a href=# title="Pokémon Black and White Versions 2">Black 2, or White 2</a>, a Virtual Console copy of <a href=# title="Pokémon Red and Blue Versions">Pokémon Red, Blue</a>, or <a href=# title="Pokémon Yellow Version">Yellow</a> (in Western languages) or <a href=# title="Pokémon Red and Green Versions">Red, Green</a>, <a href=# title="Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese)">Blue</a>, or <a href=# title="Pokémon Yellow Version">Yellow</a> (in Japanese), or a Virtual Console copy of <a href=# title="Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions">Pokémon Gold, Silver</a>, or <a href=# title="Pokémon Crystal Version">Crystal</a>. While Japanese versions of Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 are region-locked due to being <a href=# title="Nintendo DSi">DSi</a>-enhanced, Generation V games of any region can be used with Poké Transporter.</p><p>Only the Pokémon from Box 1 can be transported, and the entire <a href=# title="Pokémon Storage System">Box</a> will be transported at once, limiting the transfer to up to 30 Pokémon at a time (20 from the international versions of the Generations I and II games); if any Pokémon in the Box are ineligible to be transported, they will simply remain in the Box while all eligible Pokémon in the Box are transported. The Pokémon transported to Pokémon Bank are placed in the Transport Box. A new transfer cannot be made if there are any Pokémon in the Transport Box. When transferring from Generation V, any empty spaces in the arrangement of Box 1 are not kept; the Pokémon will arrive in the Transport Box with any empty spaces removed.</p><p>Since Pokémon cannot be moved out of the Transport Box into Pokémon Bank without a save file from a 3DS core series game, this can cause the Transport Box to become "clogged" and block further transfers if the player deletes their 3DS core series save file(s).</p><p><a href=# title="Held item">Held items</a> are handled differently depending on the source game:</p><ul><li>Any <a href=# title="Generation V">Generation V</a> game: Pokémon <a href=# title="Held item">holding items</a> are transferred, but their held items are returned to the <a href=# title=Bag>Bag</a>, or deleted if the Bag is full.</li><li>Any <a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a> game: Any Pokémon holding items are not transferred and remain in Box 1, with the player being warned that some Pokémon could not be transferred.</li><li>Any <a href=# title="Generation I">Generation I</a> game: Pokémon that would hold items if traded to a Generation II game can be transferred as if they were not holding an item.

However, it does not prevent all illegitimate Pokémon, and does stop some legitimate Pokémon.

Poké Transporter will refuse to transport Celebi if its level is below 30. Prior to this release, Poké Transporter refused to transport all Celebi from <a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a>.</p><p>Pokémon over level 100 can be transferred, but their level will be reduced to level 100.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Character_transcoding>Character transcoding</span></h2><p>Poké Transporter needs to be able to read several text variables from games it connects to, then convert these characters to the character encoding of Pokémon Bank (i.e. transcode the text). Specifically, it needs to be able to read:</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_I_and_II>Generation I and II</span></h3><p>In the Generation I and II games, the exact character encoding differs between languages; as a result, Poké Transporter applies a different transcoder depending on the game's language. There are also slight differences between the <a href=# title="Character encoding (Generation I)">Generation I</a> and <a href=# title="Character encoding (Generation II)">Generation II</a> character encodings, but these differences mostly do not apply to text transcoded by Poké Transporter (outside of some characters failing to render at all in Generation I), so the same transcoder is used for both Generation I and II games in each language.</p><p>In Generation II, the player can change the names of Boxes; the characters available to enter in Box names differ from the characters available to enter as a player's name or Pokémon's nickname, so Poké Transporter's transcoder can also handle many characters that can only appear in Box names. Additionally, several characters that players cannot type appear in preset player character names in Spanish, and the Original Trainers of certain <a href=# title="In-game trade">in-game trade</a> and <a href=# title="Gift Pokémon">gift</a> Pokémon.</p><p>In Generation I, the name of Box 1 is not read; instead, Poké Transporter uses the default name for "Box 1" in the language of Poké Transporter itself. For example, when transferring from a French Generation I game (where the name of Box 1 is "<span class=sc>Boite 1</span>") and Poké Transporter's language is set to Spanish, it will call the box "Caja 1" (the name of Box 1 in Spanish).</p><p>While the vast majority of characters are transcoded to the same character they represent in the Generation I and II games, several characters lack a single-character direct equivalent in Pokémon Bank, so instead transcode to the closest equivalent, or to a space as a fallback.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Apostrophe-letter_ligatures>Apostrophe-letter ligatures</span></h4><p>In French Pokémon Gold and Silver and all English Generation II games, there are several apostrophe-letter ligatures that the player can type in Box names. The set of ligatures is different between English and French; English exclusively has apostrophes preceding characters (e.g. <code>'d</code>, <code>'t</code>), whereas French almost exclusively has apostrophes following characters (e.g. <code>m'</code>, <code>p'</code>). The only ligature they have in common in <code>'s</code> (the only ligature in French where the apostrophe precedes the letter).</p><p>In English, these ligatures are transcoded to just the letter without the apostrophe. In French, they are all transcoded to just a space (even <code>'s</code>). The lack of proper transcoding is presumably due to the fact that these ligatures do not appear in French Pokémon Crystal.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Diacritic_characters>Diacritic characters</span></h4><p>Characters with <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:umlaut>umlauts</a> can only be typed in the German games, and do not display in the English Generation I games (being displayed as spaces instead). Even if a Pokémon that has umlauts in its name is transported from an English Generation I game, the umlauts are preserved by Poké Transporter.</p><p>In the Spanish versions of Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, several of the preset player names include <code>Á</code> or <code>Í</code>, despite the fact that players normally cannot enter these characters. Additionally, the Original Trainer of an <a href=# title="In-game trade">in-game trade</a> <a href=# title="Voltorb (Pokémon)">Voltorb</a> (FALCÁN) and the Original Trainer of the <a href=# title="Gift Pokémon">gift</a> <a href=# title="Shuckle (Pokémon)">Shuckle</a> (MANÍA) also include one of these characters. These characters display differently in different language games:</p><ul><li>In the Spanish and Italian games, both characters display correctly.</li><li>In the English games, both characters display as spaces.</li><li>In the French and German games, due to having a different character encoding, <code>Á</code> displays as <code>ç</code>, and <code>Í</code> displays as <code>ô</code>.</li></ul><p>If a Pokémon with either of these two characters in its Original Trainer is transported from an English, German, Italian, or Spanish game, they are transcoded to the correct values. However, if transported from a French game, they are transcoded to the characters they appear as in the French Generation II games. This difference is presumably due to the fact that <code>ç</code> and <code>ô</code> can appear in Box names in the French version of Pokémon Crystal, whereas they cannot in the German Generation II games (despite the French and German versions using the same encoding).</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Fullwidth_characters>Fullwidth characters</span></h4><p>Spaces have the same appearance across all languages of Generation I and II games. <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> have the same appearance across Japanese and Western language Generation I and II games.</p><p>For Japanese games, they are transcoded to fullwidth <code></code>, <code>？</code> and <code>！</code>. For Western language games, they are transcoded to regular <code></code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>!</code>. For Korean games, spaces are transcoded as fullwidth <code></code>; note that this differs from the halfwidth <code></code>that is used in Korean games from Generation IV onward.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Hangul>Hangul</span></h4><p>Seven of the hangul vowel jamo (<code>ㅘ</code>, <code>ㅙ</code>, <code>ㅚ</code>, <code>ㅝ</code>, <code>ㅞ</code>, <code>ㅟ</code>, and <code>ㅢ</code>) and two hangul blocks (<code>괻</code> and <code>읆</code>) can be typed in the Korean Generation II games, but not in Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, or Ultra Moon. These characters are treated the same as <a href=#>prohibited words</a>.</p><p>While transferring Pokémon from a game with any of these characters in the player's name, Poké Transporter displays the Trainer's name as <code>???</code>. If the name of Box 1 includes any of those characters, it is displayed as "박스1" (Box 1) instead.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=TRAINER>TRAINER</span></h4><i>Main article: <a href=#>#Pokémon from in-game trades</a></i><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Other>Other</span></h4>Multiplication sign <code>×</code> is transcoded to the lowercase letter <code>x</code>. Square brackets <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are transcoded to <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>, respectively. Ordinal indicator <code>º</code> (usable in Box names in Italian and Spanish) is transcoded to the lowercase letter <code>o</code>. PKMN <code>PK</code> is transcoded to <code>P</code>. <code>MN</code> is transcoded to <code>M</code>.<h2><span id=Modifications_to_transported_Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Modifications_to_transported_Pokémon>Modifications to transported Pokémon</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Nicknames_and_Original_Trainer_names>Nicknames and Original Trainer names</span></h3><h4><span id=Unnicknamed_Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Unnicknamed_Pokémon>Unnicknamed Pokémon</span></h4><p>The Generation I to III games do not track whether or not a Pokémon is nicknamed, only what the Pokémon's current name is; from Generation IV onward, there is an internal flag that marks whether a Pokémon is nicknamed or not, in order to track whether Pokémon from a different language games have nicknames.</p><p>When a Pokémon is transported from a Generation I or II game, if its current name is its species name in the language of the Generation I or II game it is sent from, it is treated as being unnicknamed. The Pokémon's name is checked against its species name after applying any character conversions (e.g. after converting <code>PK</code> to <code>P</code>). The Pokémon's name is considered to match if it is either in ALLCAPS or the capitalization normally used in later generations (but any other capitalization is treated as a nickname). Otherwise, its current name is permanently treated as a nickname.</p><p>The names of unnicknamed Pokémon are made to match the formatting of their species name in their language of origin in the Generation VI games. This is relevant for two main cases:</p><ul><li>Unnicknamed Pokémon originating in a Generation I to IV game (which have their species names in ALLCAPS) have their names changed to be capitalized normally.</li><li>Unnicknamed Pokémon transferred from Generation V that were evolved in a game of a language different to their <a href=# title="Language of origin">language of origin</a> (so that their name is in the language of the game they were evolved in instead of their language of origin) have their name changed to match their language of origin.</li></ul><p>Several Pokémon have <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:diacritic>diacritic</a> or <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Typographic ligature">ligature</a> characters in their French names, but these are not used in the French Generation I and II games. Due to <a href=# title="List of glitches in Generation VII">an oversight</a>, Poké Transporter expects the Pokémon's French names to include these characters in the Generation I and II games, so if an unnicknamed Pokémon is transported from a French Generation I or II game, its species name (as formatted in Generation I and II) will permanently become its nickname. As a workaround, if the Pokémon's nickname in the Generation I or II game is set to a <a href=#>censored word</a>, its nickname will be removed when it is transported to Pokémon Bank, causing it to become an unnicknamed Pokémon with the correct name.</p><p>Additionally, unnicknamed Pokémon with other special characters in their species names may also fail to be recognized as unnicknamed.</p><ul><li><a href=# title="Mr. Mime (Pokémon)">Mr. Mime</a>'s species name in Generation I and II is <code>MR.MIME</code> without the space character, so transferring an unnicknamed Mr. Mime from Generation I or II will give it MR.MIME as a nickname. Similarly, its French species name was <code>M.MIME</code> rather than M.&nbsp;Mime, so transferring from a French Virtual Console game will give it M.MIME as a nickname.<ul><li>In version 1.2, Poké Transporter additionally failed to handle the <a href=# title="Character encoding (Generation I)">0xE8</a> (period) in the species name of Mr. Mime, presumably due to the nickname entry screen's identical-looking character actually being 0xF2 (decimal point), which did get properly handled. The unhandled period would turn into a hyphen instead, so transferring an unnicknamed Mr. Mime from Generation I would give it <code>MR-MIME</code> as a nickname. (<a href=# title="Mew glitch">Glitches</a> are required to obtain an unnicknamed Mr. Mime in Generation I without trading back from Generation II. The species name of Mr. Mime includes 0xE8 in the French, English, Spanish, and Italian Virtual Console games.) In version 1.3 onward, the period and decimal point are both properly handled as the same character, but the lack of a space in Mr. Mime's Generation I and II name is still not handled correctly, hence why the issue described above occurs.</li></ul></li><li>In version 1.2, Poké Transporter failed to handle the apostrophe in the species name of <a href=# title="Farfetch'd (Pokémon)">Farfetch'd</a>, presumably due to the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Text entry in the Pokémon games">nickname entry screen</a> not having an apostrophe, causing it to turn into a space instead. Transferring an unnicknamed Farfetch'd from Generation I would then give it <code>FARFETCH D</code> as a nickname. (In Generation I, unnicknamed Farfetch'd can be normally obtained in <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Pokémon Yellow">Pokémon Yellow</a>. The species name of Farfetch'd includes an apostrophe in English, Spanish, and Italian.) This was corrected in version 1.3.</li></ul><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Character_limitations>Character limitations</span></h4><p>A name consisting of only spaces, which is only possible in Generation I, will remain unchanged. If a Pokémon has <code>PK</code>, <code>MN</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, or <code>×</code> in its <a href=# title=Nickname>nickname</a> or <a href=# title="Original Trainer">original Trainer</a>, this will be converted to <code>P</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, or <code>x</code>, respectively, upon being transported.</p><p>Pokémon transported from a French Generation I or II game that originally had <code>Á</code> or <code>Í</code> in their Original Trainer (in their original language) have this character become <code>ç</code> or <code>ô</code> instead (respectively), matching their display in the French Generation I and II games. (These characters are correctly preserved when transferring from any other Western language, despite these characters having the exact same appearance in the German games as they do in the French games.)</p><p>In Japanese, between September 22, 2017 and November 19, 2017 (after <a href=# title="Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a> were released on the <a href=# title="Virtual Console">Virtual Console</a> but before they were directly compatible with Poké Transporter), transferring a Pokémon from a Virtual Console game with an exclamation point or question mark in its nickname or OT would cause these characters to be converted into spaces.<a href=#>[4]</a> (This required trading the Pokémon to a Generation I Virtual Console game and then transferring through Poké Transporter. The Japanese Generation II games allow entering exclamation points/question marks but the Japanese Generation I games do not. This did not occur in other languages, presumably because it is possible to enter exclamation points/question marks in Generation I in those languages.) Conversely, the kana を / ヲ <i>wo</i> and small vowel katakana did not have this issue despite also being characters that could be entered in Japanese Generation II but not Japanese Generation I. This was fixed by the release of Poké Transporter compatibility with the Generation II games.</p><p>In the <a href=# title="Character encoding (Generation I)">Generation I</a> and <a href=# title="Character encoding (Generation II)">Generation II character encodings</a>, several pairs of hiragana and katakana share the same code points due to being rendered the same way in-game; in later generations, this is not the case, with each character having its own code point. These characters are the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:hiragana>hiragana</a> <code>へ</code> (including <code>べ</code> and <code>ぺ</code>) and <code>り</code> and the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:katakana>katakana</a> <code>ヘ</code> (including <code>ベ</code> and <code>ペ</code>) and <code>リ</code>. Poké Transporter converts the character to hiragana or katakana depending on the first kana character of the Pokémon's name (i.e. the first character other than a space, <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:chōonpu>chōonpu</a>, question mark, or exclamation mark). If the first character is hiragana (other than the four kana in question), the character is converted to hiragana <code>へ</code> or <code>り</code>; if the first character is katakana or any of the four kana in question, the character is converted to katakana.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_from_in-game_trades></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_from_in-game_trades>Pokémon from in-game trades</span></h4><p>In Generation I, the Original Trainer of Pokémon from <a href=# title="In-game trade">in-game trades</a> is a control character (<a href=# title="Character encoding (Generation I)">code point</a> <code>0x5D</code>) that displays Trainer in the games' language (e.g. TRAINER in English). Transported Pokémon have this OT converted to plaintext, with regular capitalization and any abbreviations expanded, based on the language of the transferring game. (As a result, the Korean and Chinese OTs exist in the data of Poké Transporter but are not actually used.)</p><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><th rowspan=2>Language</th><th colspan=3>OT</th></tr><tr><th>Gen I</th><th>Gen II</th><th>Bank</th></tr><tr><td>Japanese</td><td>トレーナー</td><td>トレーナー</td><td>トレーナー</td></tr><tr><td>English</td><td>TRAINER</td><td>TRAINER</td><td>Trainer</td></tr><tr><td>French</td><td>DRES.</td><td>DRESSEUR</td><td>Dresseur</td></tr><tr><td>German</td><td>TRAINER</td><td>TRAINER</td><td>Trainer</td></tr><tr><td>Italian</td><td>ALLEN.</td><td>ALLEN.</td><td>Allenatore</td></tr><tr><td>Spanish</td><td>ENTREN.</td><td>ENTREN.</td><td>Entrenador</td></tr><tr><td>Korean</td><td>N/A</td><td>트레이너</td><td>트레이너</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese (Traditional)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>訓練家</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese (Simplified)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>训练家</td></tr><tr><th colspan=4></th></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Censored_words>Censored words</span></h4><p>If a Pokémon's nickname contains a prohibited word, the Pokémon's nickname will be erased, reverting to the default species name in that Pokémon's language of origin. (Since the Generation I and II games do not track language of origin, Pokémon transferred from the Virtual Console games have their language of origin set to the transferring game's language.) Poké Transporter informs the user when this occurs. The word check is applied after removing spaces and after converting characters such as <code>PK</code>.</p><p>The list of prohibited words is stored server-side, varies over time,<a href=#>[5]</a><a href=#>[6]</a> and does not match either the Generation V filter list, any of the <a href=# title="Nintendo 3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>'s filter lists in any region or language, or any combination of the former.
